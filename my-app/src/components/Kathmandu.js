<h1>Tell me about Kathmandu.</h1>
<p>Kathmandu is the capital and largest city of Nepal, with a population of around 1.4 million people. It is also the gateway to the Nepalese Himalayas, and as such is a popular destination for trekkers and mountaineers. The city is situated at an elevation of around 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) above sea level, and is surrounded by mountains. Kathmandu is a bustling and vibrant city, with a wide range of things to see and do. The city's Durbar Square is a particularly popular tourist destination, with its ancient temples and palaces.</p>
