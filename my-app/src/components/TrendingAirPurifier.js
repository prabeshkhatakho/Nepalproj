<h1>tell me about trending air purifier</h1>
<p>There is no one definitive answer to this question, as air purifiers can trend for a variety of reasons. However, some possible reasons why an air purifier may be trending could include that it is a new release and people are eager to try it out, it is particularly effective at purifying air, or it is more affordable than other air purifiers on the market.</p>
